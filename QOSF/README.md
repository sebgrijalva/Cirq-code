# Returning with equal probability |00> and |11>

This is a code in jupyter notebook for understanding how to produce the pair {|00> , |11>} with equal probabilty using a small quantum circuit.
It's part of the tasks proposed by the QOSF to apply for a mentorship within their program.

I recommend opening the ipynb notebook in Google Colab and the grijalva_task2.pdf file in this folder.
